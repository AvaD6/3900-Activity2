            Ajax is a 7 year Bengal born sometime in August of 2016. I recently adopted him from a local 
            shelter in March of 2023. He is a sweetheart who can be pretty vocal about pets and food.

            This is a very simple, sample site to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills.
            These skills are critical to developing my web applications
